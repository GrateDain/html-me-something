        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After flying into San Jose we drove to the beach community of XXX where we checked into
        our forrest bungalo and got settled in.  The next day we started early with a walk down to a local chocolate farm
        and cafe for breakfast before touring (AND TASTING!) the operation from tree to shiny wrapped bar.  Our favorite 
        part was easily the end, where high on a cliff with Caribean breezes we made our own chocolate mixes using 
        various spices and herbs.  Garlic, chili and sea salt chocolate, delicious who knew!<br/>
        Having spent the morning trekking up and down the vertical trails of the chocolate farm, we took the afternoon 
        easy, picking up supplies then relaxing at the beach. Watched surfers, swam and just layed about til a sunset 
        stroll home.
        We closed our first full day at the restraunt of our host, who prior to setteling down in Costa Rica was an chef 
        on yachts across the world. An amazing buffet feast of Thai, Indian and Sushi; along with a local favorites didn't 
        disappoint.  He even joined us for a glass of his special house made chocolate infused liqour, which was the perfect 
        nutty rich compliment to our shared slice of chocolate cake.<br/>
        Sated, stuffed and blissful, we explored the night markets a bit on our way home to a sound slumber.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our first stop of the day, a Sloth Santuary!  Which could of been a complete bust, we arrived 
        right when they opened to get a full day of travel in, only to find out they had a cruise ship group on the way and 
        wouldn't have an opening til 11.  Needing to be on the road we sadly resigned ourselfs to visiting their mascot in the 
        lobby. Then as we were heading to the car, they come running out, the cruise people are going to be an hour late, so 
        instead we got a private 2 person tour.  We learned so much about sloths (related to ant eaters, poop once a week!).
        However the real joy was fawning over all those cute faces.  Then we headed off on a wild Coasta Rican road and off-road
        trip.  Steep, narrow, bumpy and two-way; at one point getting passed by a motorcycle with a Christmas tree on it. To 
        the peak of Irazu Volcano, h
